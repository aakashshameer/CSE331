## Program operation (correctness) and extra credit

### Correctness Score: 2/3

### Extra Credit Score: -/3

#### Program operation/extra credit feedback

You need to click buttons twice in order for them to work and certain input like
a missing comma causes the program to crash. This should instead give a helpful
message.

## Code quality and implementation

### Design: 3/3

### Code quality: 2/3

### Mechanics: 3/3

#### Code Review Feedback

Your design is fine beside the issue with buttons needing to be clicked twice
(this is a common error when React's event-driven interface isn't being used as
they intended), however your code should have more comments.
