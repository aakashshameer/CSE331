#### Overall Feedback

Great job - you are only missing some little details in your documentation.

#### More Details

- Your BFS method is complex, and should hence have some internal comments/documentation to improve its readability and understandability.

- For next time, if you implement a class that isn't an ADT, you should add an internal comment that explicitly
says so where the ADT/RI would normally go.

says so where the ADT/RI would normally go.

- You should specify how your pathfinding operation works, such as how 
your algorithm breaks ties.
