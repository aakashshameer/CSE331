#List the children of these nodes numerically

created graph childrenGraph

added node A to childrenGraph
added node B to childrenGraph
added node C to childrenGraph

added edge 3.000 from A to B in childrenGraph
added edge 10.000 from B to C in childrenGraph
added edge 5.000 from A to C in childrenGraph
added edge 2.000 from B to A in childrenGraph

the children of A in childrenGraph are: B(3.000) C(5.000)
the children of B in childrenGraph are: A(2.000) C(10.000)
