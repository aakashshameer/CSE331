#Find a path with the Dijkstra's algorithm with TwoNodes

created graph twoNodesGraph

added node A to twoNodesGraph
added node B to twoNodesGraph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in twoNodesGraph
added edge 2.000 from A to B in twoNodesGraph

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
