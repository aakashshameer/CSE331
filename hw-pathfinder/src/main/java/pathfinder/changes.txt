Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

The only changes I made to my graph class and edge class is by including generics. In this assignment, we saw the use
of different types of object like Path, Point and etc. Therefore, using these generics really come in hand as we can use these
classes for different objects which reduces the need of creating new classes for these different objects.
