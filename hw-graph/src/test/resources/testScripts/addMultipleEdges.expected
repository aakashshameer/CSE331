#Test to create two nodes, with multiple edges in the graph

#Create a graph
create graph graphName

#Add a node
added node b to graphName
added node c to graphName

#Add four edges
added edge BB from b to b in graphName
added edge BC from b to c in graphName
added edge BC2 from b to c in graphName
added edge CB from c to b in graphName

#Print nodes in the graph
graphName contains: b c

#Print outgoing edges from b
the children of b in graphName are: b(BB) c(BC) c(BC2)

#Print outgoing edges from c
the children of c in graphName are: b(CB)
