#Test to create two nodes, with multiple edges in the graph

#Create a graph
create graph dgraph

#Add a node
added node b to dgraph
added node c to dgraph

#Add four edges
added edge BB from b to b in dgraph
added edge BC from b to c in dgraph
added edge BC2 from b to c in dgraph
added edge CB from c to b in dgraph

#Print nodes in the graph
dgraph contains: b c

#Print outgoing edges from b
the children of b in dgraph are: b(BB) c(BC) c(BC2)

#Print outgoing edges from c
the children of c in dgraph are: b(CB)
