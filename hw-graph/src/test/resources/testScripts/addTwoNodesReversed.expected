#Test to create two nodes in the graph but in a reverseOrder

#Create a graph
create graph graphName

#Add a node
added node b to graphName
added node a to graphName

#Print nodes in the graph
graphName contains: a b

#Print outgoing edges from a
the children of a in graphName are:

#Print outgoing edges from b
the children of a in graphName are:
