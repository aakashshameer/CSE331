#Test to create two nodes in the graph but in a reverseOrder

#Create a graph
created graph dgraph

#Add a node
added node b to dgraph
added node a to dgraph

#Print nodes in the graph
dgraph contains: a b

#Print outgoing edges from a
the children of a in dgraph are:

#Print outgoing edges from b
the children of b in dgraph are:
