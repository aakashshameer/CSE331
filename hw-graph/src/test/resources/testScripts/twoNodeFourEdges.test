#Test to create two nodes, two self-edges and two edges between different nodes

#Create a graph
CreateGraph dgraph

#Add two nodes
Added dgraph b
Added dgraph c

#Add two self edges
AddEdge dgraph b b BB
AddEdge dgraph c c CC

#Add two edges between different nodes
AddEdge dgraph b c BC
AddEdge dgraph c b CB

#Print the nodes in the graph
ListNodes dgraph

#Print outgoing edges from b
ListChildren dgraph b

#Print outgoing edges from c
ListChildren dgraph c
