#Test to create two nodes, one self-edge and one edge between different nodes in the graph

#Create a graph
CreateGraph graphName

#Add two nodes
AddNode graphName b
AddNode graphName c

#Add one self edge
AddEdge graphName b b BB

#Add one edge between different nodes
AddEdge graphName b c BC

#Print the nodes in the graph
ListNode graphName

#Print outgoing edges from b
ListChildren graphName b

#Print outgoing edges from c
ListChildren graphName c
