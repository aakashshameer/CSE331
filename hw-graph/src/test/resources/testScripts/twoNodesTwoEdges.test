#Test to create two nodes, one self-edge and one edge between different nodes in the graph

#Create a graph
CreateGraph dgraph

#Add two nodes
AddNode dgraph b
AddNode dgraph c

#Add one self edge
AddEdge dgraph b b BB

#Add one edge between different nodes
AddEdge dgraph b c BC

#Print the nodes in the graph
ListNode dgraph

#Print outgoing edges from b
ListChildren dgraph b

#Print outgoing edges from c
ListChildren dgraph c
