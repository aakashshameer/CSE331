#Test to create two nodes, with multiple edges in the graph

#Create a graph
CreateGraph graphName

#Add a node
AddNode graphName b
AddNode graphName c

#Add four edges
AddEdge graphName b b BB
AddEdge graphName b c BC
AddEdge graphName b c BC2
AddEdge graphName c b CB

#Print nodes in the graph
ListNode graphName

#Print outgoing edges from b
ListChildren graphName b

#Print outgoing edges from c
