#Test to create two nodes, two self-edges and two edges between different nodes

#Create a graph
create graph dgraph

#Add two nodes
added node b to dgraph
added node c to dgraph

#Add two self edges
added edge BB from b to b in dgraph
added edge CC from c to c in dgraph

#Add two edges between different nodes
added edge BC from b to c in dgraph
added edge CB from c to b in dgraph

#Print the nodes in the graph
dgraph contains: b c

#Print outgoing edges from b
the children of b in dgraph are: b(BB) c(BC)

#Print outgoing edges from c
the children of c in dgraph are: b(CB) c(CC)
