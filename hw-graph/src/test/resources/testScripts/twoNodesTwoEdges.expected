#Test to create two nodes, one self-edge and one edge between different nodes in the graph

#Create a graph
create graph dgraph

#Add two nodes
added node b to dgraph
added node c to dgraph

#Add one self edge
added edge BB from b to b in dgraph

#Add one edge between different nodes
added edge BC from b to c in dgraph

#Print the nodes in the graph
dgraph contains: b c

#Print outgoing edges from b
the children of b in dgraph are: b(BB) c(BC)

#Print outgoing edges from c
the children of c in dgraph are:
