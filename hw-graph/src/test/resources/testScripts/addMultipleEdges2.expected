#Test to create three nodes, with multiple edges in the graph

#Create a graph
create graph dgraph

#Add a node
added node a to dgraph
added node b to dgraph
added node c to dgraph

#Add six edges
added edge AA from a to a in dgraph
added edge AC from a to c in dgraph
added edge BB from b to b in dgraph
added edge BC from b to c in dgraph
added edge BC2 from b to c in dgraph
added edge CA from c to a in dgraph
added edge CB from c to b in dgraph

#Print nodes in the graph
dgraph contains: a b c

#Print outgoing edges from a
the children of a in dgraph are: a(AA) c(AC)

#Print outgoing edges from b
the children of b in dgraph are: b(BB) c(BC) c(BC2)

#Print outgoing edges from c
the children of c in dgraph are: a(CA) b(CB)
