#Test to create two nodes, two self-edges and two edges between different nodes

#Create a graph
CreateGraph graphName

#Add two nodes
Added graphName b
Added graphName c

#Add two self edges
AddEdge graphName b b BB
AddEdge graphName c c CC

#Add two edges between different nodes
AddEdge graphName b c BC
AddEdge graphName c b CB

#Print the nodes in the graph
ListNodes graphName

#Print outgoing edges from b
ListChildren graphName b

#Print outgoing edges from c
ListChildren graphName c
