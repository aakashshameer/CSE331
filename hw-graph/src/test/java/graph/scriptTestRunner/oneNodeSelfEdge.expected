#Test to create a node and an edge to itself in graph

#Create a graph
create graph graphName

#Add a node
added node a to graphName

#Add an edge
added edge AA from a to a in graphName

#Print nodes in the graph
graphName contains: a

#Print outgoing edges from a
the children of a in graphName are: a(AA)
