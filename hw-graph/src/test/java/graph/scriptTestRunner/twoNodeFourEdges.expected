#Test to create two nodes, two self-edges and two edges between different nodes

#Create a graph
create graph graphName

#Add two nodes
added node b to graphName
added node c to graphName

#Add two self edges
added edge BB from b to b in graphName
added edge CC from c to c in graphName

#Add two edges between different nodes
added edge BC from b to c in graphName
added edge CB from c to b in graphName

#Print the nodes in the graph
graphName contains: b c

#Print outgoing edges from b
the children of b in graphName are: b(BB) c(BC)

#Print outgoing edges from c
the children of c in graphName are: b(CB) c(CC)
