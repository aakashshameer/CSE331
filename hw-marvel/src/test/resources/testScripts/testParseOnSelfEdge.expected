# test Parser on SelfEdge data to make sure MarvelPath
# doesn't allow building reflexive edges

# Parse through the data and build the graph
loaded graph selfEdge

# List nodes and edges to see if the graph is built correctly
selfEdge contains: A B C
the children of A in selfEdge are: B(AB)
the children of B in selfEdge are: A(AB) C(BC)
the children of C in selfEdge are: B(BC)
